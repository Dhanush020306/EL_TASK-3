# EL_TASK-3
# NETWORKING BASICS
In this task we are going to learn about basic networking concepts which includes installing wireshark and many more things.

# Objectives
- Install Wireshark and capture Life traffic
- Filter Packets by protocol
- Observe 3-way handshake
- Analize traffic

# Tools Used
- Wireshark in Windows

# Learning and Findings
**1. Networking Basics**
  - IP Address: Logical address used to route data across networks (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
  - MAC Address: Permanent physical address of a network interface (e.g., 00-B0-D0-63-C2-26).
  - DNS: Translates human domain names (google.com) into IP addresses.
  - TCP vs. UDP:
    - TCP: Reliable, connection-oriented, uses a 3-way handshake (e.g., Web browsing).
    - UDP: Fast, connectionless, no delivery guarantee (e.g., Video streaming).

**2. Wireshark Installation and live capturing**
  - Install Wireshark for windows from Google
  - Select Wifi and start live capturing by double-clicking on it

**3. Filter Packets**
  - We can filter Packets by typing dns,tcp,http in the search bar at the top.

**4. Network Analysis**
  - I saw a 3-way handshake, various dns queries, encrypted and unencrypted traffic.

**5. Packet Capture**
  - Using Wireshark we can capture all the traffic from our computer, I have attached a analysis file to this repo!
